            <p>
              This website may use essential cookies, local storage, and basic analytics tools to understand site usage
              and improve performance. Third-party advertising services, including Google AdSense when enabled, may use
              cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to deliver ads, limit ad frequency, and measure campaign
              effectiveness.

              When you first visit, a cookie consent banner lets you choose <strong>Essential only</strong> or{' '}
              <strong>Accept all</strong>. Essential-only mode enables basic Google Analytics to understand site usage
              without loading personalized advertising. Accept all enables advertising cookies when an ad partner (such
              as Google AdSense) is active on the site.

              Monash Wam Calculator may display advertisements from partners such as Google AdSense when that account is
              approved and enabled to student-relevant tools (for example writing aids,
              VPN, or cloud storage) via networks such as Commission Factory or Awin. Analytics partners may track
              referrals using cookies or similar technologies after you click a tracked link.

    question: 'How is WAM calculated?',
    answer: 'Your WAM is calculated by multiplying the mark you received for each unit by its credit point value, and then dividing the sum of these by the total credit points you have enrolled in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a good WAM?',
    answer: 'A WAM of 80+ is High Distinction (HD), 70-79 is Distinction (D), 60-69 is Credit (C), and 50-59 is Pass (P). A good WAM depends on your goals, but typically 70+ is considered strong.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are first year units weighted differently?',
    answer: 'Some faculties weight first year (level 1) units at 0.5 (half weight) when calculating your official WAM. Our calculator automatically handles this when you select your subjects.',
